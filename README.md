OMG, just finished watching Raid 2, and holy crap, my brain is still catching up with all that action, like, what the hell did I just witness?? The fights were insane, like, these guys are superheroes or something, defying gravity and all. And that one scene, you know the one in the kitchen, had me on the edge of my seat, literally vibrating, dude. It’s like, how do they even choreograph such madness? I'm exhausted just from watching!

You know, I kept thinking, if I could download the movie directly into my adrenaline system, I’d probably need a week to recover, haha. Seriously though, my eyes are all bugged out right now, no joke.

Anyway, after watching the movie, I'm just sitting here feeling like I should sign up for some martial arts class or something. Except, haha, who am I kidding? I’d probably last 3 minutes before begging for a time-out. Or just grab a popcorn and keep hiding in my own shadow.

> But dude, doesn’t it make you feel like an action star for like, 5 whole minutes afterward? Just wanting to flip over couches or some legit crazy stuff, until reality kicks in and you remember you’ll just bruise a pinky, lol. I mean, it’s fun to imagine though.

Oh, and the music! How do they make it so intense? It’s like a freakin’ rollercoaster ride for your ears, with a beat that doesn’t quit. But then there’s that tiny voice in my head that’s like, “meep, meep, you know you can’t handle this, sit down, relax.” Yeah right, voice, you’re not the boss of me.

Randomly, if I ever join a gang or some cool secret agent squad, I wanna look that cool while doing hand-to-hand combat. But let's be real, I'm only good at hand-to-pizza combat, haha.

// int randomVar = new Random().Next(10);

Okay, I just dropped in a line of code like a confused parrot, who knows why, but it’s there. So yeah, back to normal things and hoping my heart rate comes down soon. I’m like, “chill out, body, it’s cinema, not real life.” But damn, that was epic.
